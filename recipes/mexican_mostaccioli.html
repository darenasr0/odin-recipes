    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Stretch out leftover ground beef with this budget-friendly, Mexican-inspired pasta dish.</p>
    <p>"It tastes like really good Hamburger Helper," says reviewer Kimberly Hogan.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package mostaccioli pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (24 ounce) jar picante sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can stewed tomatoes with juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook mostaccioli at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a large pot over medium-high heat until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.</li>
        <li>Add picante sauce and stewed tomatoes to the ground beef; cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften completely, about 10 minutes. Gently stir the cooked mostaccioli into the ground beef mixture. Add Mexican-style cheese; cook and stir until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
